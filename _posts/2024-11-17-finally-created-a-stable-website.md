I just want to share my thoughts with people. The current options are shit. Which ones, you may ask. The social media ones. I'll go through them one-by-one.
- Facebook: Nobody uses it anymore. Just exists for legacy reasons. In fact, I don't even remember what I last posted there. 
- Instagram: I use it once in a while. It's good to reach out to people who hardly care about you and don't really reply to you anymore. Good place to find out what others are doing. Even better place to doom scroll. Damn those insta ML engineers are doing a good job.
- Twitter: Purely professional. I'll post there only about Tesla, as long as I'm a part of this company. 
- Snapchat: Too modern for my taste.
- Reddit: Anonymity is spoiling my mood. Idiots talk whatever they want and I lose my cool at times :P. 

Instead, I'll post here without giving a damn. I'll probably take down this post in a bit, but hey, first post. Good job, Mr.Rangeesh. First post at the age of 28. Jeez.
