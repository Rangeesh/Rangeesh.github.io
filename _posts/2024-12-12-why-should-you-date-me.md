### What's my definition of dating?
Here's dating doesn't necessarily mean "just dating for fun". It's more along the lines of "dating to marry". It's a very time consuming process and hence not worth the effort to temporaririly meet someone. 

### What do I bring to the table?
- Hopefully, from my perspective, I hope you find me to be an understanding person, who's kinda ambitious to achieve a few goals. If you're ambitious too, let's find some middle ground to ensure we both get what we want. 
- I try to keep the house lively. Humour is a big part of my life, witty replies is something I like to give and receive. 
- Well cooked dishes. Biriyani is my fav, and my biriyani will become your fav too.
- If you play sports, you have a companion for all kinds of sports - and not just a rando guy who is a beginner but someone who is actually good. I'm up for playing anytime, and I play table tennis, tennis and badminton kinda okay. Football too, but not that great, yet. 
- A mindset of doing your best. I try to bring that as much as possible, but sometimes I flounder. But I pick myself up and get back at it. 
- Good character. Mistakes might be made, owning them and taking the right action items is necessary. Can't let ego come in the way. 

### What do I expect from you?
- Three things, according to Naval Ravikant - high intelligence, high energy and high integrity. I'll clarify what these mean. 
- High Intelligence -> Being smart enought to quickly understand what's going on and react accordingly. Also, have a clarity on your thoughts and have no ego. Intelligence here refers to emotional intelligence. Note: This is not related to your college degree. I don't care if you're from an IIT/Stanford or have a PhD.
- High Energy -> Proactive in solving problems, taking initiative. I generally slack at this, but consciously working on improving this - hence the whole website. Ambitious folks have a lot of energy. 
- High integrity -> Don't lie, or cheat. If you don't have any integrity, why even bother. Mistakes might be made, but make the right reprimands for it and continue with life. Gaslighting isn't the right way to deal with issues - talking from experience. 

### What are the long term goals?
- Earlier, it was earn enough and go back to India. Reason? Family is back home. Now? I feel it's still the same. I don't want my parents to struggle as they get older. Am I really sacrificing personal growth for them? I don't think so. If you're smart enough, you'll be able to grow whether you're in India or in the US. 

### What are my shortcomings?
- Not able to bring out my best by myself -> If I don't have a driving purpose, I tend to slack. Also, my drive these days are short-term. Not sure why. 
- I'm losing hair. :(  
- I spend quite some time at work, but I think that's expected.
